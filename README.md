# Neuro-Symbolic Toolkit for Clinical Data Management

Welcome to the Neuro-Symbolic Toolkit for Clinical Data Management! This repository provides a suite of tools for managing, validating, and analyzing clinical data using neuro-symbolic methods. The toolkit is designed to facilitate the alignment of clinical entities, validate facts, and ensure semantic completeness. It is especially tailored for data from clinical datasets such as MIMIC-III.

## Features
- **Entity Alignment**: Tools for aligning clinical entities across datasets.
- **Fact Validation**: Methods for validating the consistency of clinical facts.
- **Semantic Completeness**: Ensure the semantic integrity of your clinical data.
- **MIMIC-III Integration**: Built-in support for the MIMIC-III dataset.
